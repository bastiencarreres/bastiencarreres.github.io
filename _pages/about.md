After obtaining a master's degree in [Subatomic Physics and Cosmology](https://formations.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr/catalogue-2021/master-XB/master-physique-IAQK7WZY/parcours-physique-subatomique-et-cosmologie-2e-annee-IAY1KEEB.html) at _[Universit√© Grenoble-Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/)_ I completed my PhD in Astrophycs and Cosmology at _[Centre de Physique des Particules de Marseille](https://www.cppm.in2p3.fr/web/fr/index.html)_.

**I'm currently working as a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Cosmology group of Duke Universty](https://physics.duke.edu/research/astrophysics).**

My research focuses on understanding the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe and the nature of dark energy.
In particular, I use type Ia supernovae in the nearby universe to measure distances and infer the peculiar velocity field. This field is linked to the growth of structures and allows to test the standard model of cosmology and general relativity.

I am involved in the Zwicky Transient Facility ([ZTF](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/)) and in the Rubin Observatory - Legacy Survey of Space and Time ([Rubin-LSST](https://www.lsst.org/)) within the Dark Energy Science Collaboraration ([DESC](https://lsstdesc.org/)).
