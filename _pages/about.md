I am currently working as a Post Doctorate Associate in the cosmology group at Duke University.

My research focuses on understanding the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe and the dark energy.
In particular, I use type Ia supernovae in the nearby universe to measure distances and infer the peculiar velocity field. This field is linked to the growth of structures and allows to test the standard model of cosmology and general relativity.

I am involved in the Zwicky Transient Facility (<a href="https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/">ZTF</a>). I am also working in the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) within the Dark Energy Science Collaboraration (<a href="https://lsstdesc.org/">DESC</a>).
