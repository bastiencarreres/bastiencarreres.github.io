  abstract = {Measurements of the growth rate of structures at \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 0.1 with peculiar velocity surveys have the potential of testing the validity of general relativity on cosmic scales. In this work, we present growth-rate measurements from realistic simulated sets of type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We describe our simulation methodology, the light-curve fitting, and peculiar velocity estimation. Using the maximum likelihood method, we derived constraints on \emph{f{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{8{$<$}sub/{$>$} using only ZTF SN Ia peculiar velocities. We carefully tested the method and we quantified biases due to selection effects (photometric detection, spectroscopic follow-up for typing) on several independent realizations. We simulated the equivalent of 6 years of ZTF data, and considering an unbiased spectroscopically typed sample at \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 0.06, we obtained unbiased estimates of \emph{f{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{8{$<$}sub/{$>$} with an average uncertainty of 19\% precision. We also investigated the information gain in applying bias correction methods. Our results validate our framework, which can be used on real ZTF data.}}}}}}},

In this paper, I present my work to prepare the future analysis of $f\sigma_8$ with the maximum likelihood method from SNe Ia data only.

I show that using SNe Ia data from the full 6 years of the ZTF II with a cut at a redshift of $z < 0.06$ to avoid selection due to magnitude limit, we can expect an unbiased measurement of $f\sigma_8$ with an error of $\sim 19 \%$.},

  abstract = {Type Ia supernovae ( are used to determine the distance-redshift relation and build the Hubble diagram. Neglecting their host-galaxy peculiar velocities (PVs) may bias the measurement of cosmological parameters. The smaller the redshift, the larger the effect is. We used realistic simulations of observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to investigate the effect of different methods of taking PVs into account. We studied the impact of neglecting galaxy PVs and their correlations in an analysis of the Hubble diagram. We find that it is necessary to use the PV full covariance matrix computed from the velocity power spectrum to take the sample variance into account. Considering the results we have obtained using simulations, we determine the PV systematic effects in the context of the ZTF SN Ia DR2 sample. We determine the PV impact on the intercept of the Hubble diagram, \$a\_B\$, which is directly linked to the measurement of \$H\_0\$. We show that not taking into account PVs and their correlations results in a shift in the \$H\_0\$ value of about \$1.0\$ and a slight underestimation of the \$H\_0\$ error bar.},

  abstract = {Measuring the growth rate of large-scale structures (\$f\$) as a function of redshift has the potential to break degeneracies between modified gravity and dark energy models, when combined with expansion-rate probes. Direct estimates of peculiar velocities of galaxies have gained interest to estimate \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8\$. In particular, field-level methods can be used to fit the field nuisance parameter along with cosmological parameters simultaneously. This article aims to provide the community with an unified framework for the theoretical modeling of the likelihood-based field-level inference by performing fast field covariance calculations for velocity and density fields. Our purpose is to lay the foundations for non-linear extension of the likelihood-based method at the field level. We develop a generalized framework, implemented in the dedicated software flip to perform a likelihood-based inference of \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8\$. We derive a new field covariance model, which includes wide-angle corrections. We also include the models previously described in the literature inside our framework. We compare their performance against ours, we validate our model by comparing it with the two-point statistics of a recent N-body simulation. The tests we perform allow us to validate our software and determine the appropriate wavenumber range to integrate our covariance model and its validity in terms of separation. Our framework allows for a wider wavenumber coverage used in our calculations than previous works, which is particularly interesting for non-linear model extensions. Finally, our generalized framework allows us to efficiently perform a survey geometry-dependent Fisher forecast of the \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ parameter. We show that the Fisher forecast method we developed gives an error bar that is 30 \% closer to a full likelihood-based estimation than a standard volume Fisher forecast.},
